# Self-Update Instructions

## Scope

`selfupdate/` checks GitHub releases, caches update metadata, verifies
downloaded assets, extracts archives, and installs a replacement binary. Treat
this package as security-sensitive because it moves bytes from the network to an
executable path.

## Invariants

- Never install an asset without a checksum.
- When signature verification is enabled, verify the checksum payload before
  downloading or installing the archive.
- Keep checksum, signature, release metadata, and asset-name validation tied to
  the update request. Do not let metadata from one asset authorize another.
- Archive extraction must not write outside the chosen destination or preserve
  privilege-changing file modes.
- Install through a staging path and atomic replacement where the platform
  allows it. Do not leave a half-written destination on ordinary failures.
- Keep cache-only update metadata from being installable; force a fresh check
  before install.
- Do not add live GitHub calls to tests. Use fake HTTP handlers and explicit
  responses.

## Tests

- Cover both success and refusal paths when changing verification, asset naming,
  caching, archive extraction, or install behavior.
- Use small in-memory or temp-file fixtures. Do not download real releases.
- Preserve tests that prove the archive extractor cannot write outside the
  destination directory.
