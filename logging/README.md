# logging

Package `logging` centralizes the shared `slog` setup used by kenn-io Go CLIs
and services.

It supports:

- `json`, `text`, and TTY-aware `auto` stderr formatting.
- `debug`, `info`, `warn` / `warning`, and `error` levels.
- Optional environment level override with a caller-supplied env var name.
- Optional JSON file logging with daily paths, size rotation, retained rotated
  files, and stderr/file fanout.
- Optional per-run id attributes and a file-only logger for TUI commands.

## Migration Notes

For simple stderr-only logging, replace private level parsing and TTY selection
with `logging.NewLogger`. Pass the existing stderr writer, `Format`, `Level`,
`AddSource`, and any caller-owned `EnvLevelVar`. Leave `File` and `AddRunID`
unset to preserve no-file, no-run-id behavior.

For CLI file logging, map the existing config into `logging.Options` with
`AddRunID: true`, the stderr writer, the configured level, and
`FileOptions{Enabled: true, Dir: logsDir, DailyFilePrefix: appName,
MaxBytes: maxFileBytes, KeepRotated: keepRotated}`. Commands that enter a TUI or
alternate screen should continue to swap to `Result.FileOnlyLogger()` and call
`Result.Close()` during shutdown.
