# embedconfig invariants

- Keep model, role, and input settings in their own types. Do not collapse
  them into one flat configuration struct of scalars.
- Do not default dimensions or truncation. Those choices change
  compatibility.
- `Model.Validate` accepts cosine only. `MetricDotProduct` and `MetricL2`
  stay declared and fail validation until those distances can be stored.
- `InputLimits.MaxSpans` of zero means no span cap. It is valid. It does not
  mean the token window is unset.
- `ApplyDefaults` may fill batch size 32, transport timeout 30s, and a 32 MiB
  response cap. It must not invent a model, a dimension, or a chunk limit.
- Identities live on `embedmodel.Descriptor`, not here. Keep query-side
  policy such as retrieval budgets and generation serving out of this
  package until a kit package consumes it.
- API keys are not fields of these types. Callers resolve secrets and pass
  them to the HTTP client.
- `CanonicalEndpoint` and `Origin` reject an empty hostname, including a
  port with no host. An IPv6 zone is not lowercased; its percent signs are
  encoded as `%25`. Link-local checks use the address without the zone.
- `vector.Split` remains a rune window helper. Token limits here do not
  require that splitter.
